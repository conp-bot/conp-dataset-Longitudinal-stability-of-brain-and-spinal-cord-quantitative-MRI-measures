## Description

__About: __Tabular (CSV) files are generated by the Courtois Neuromod[ structural data processing workflow](https://github.com/courtois-neuromod/anat-processing). These files contain quantitative MRI metrics such as T1, MTsat, and MTR, in addition to fundamental diffusion tensor imaging indices like RD and FA derived from brain data. The results also encompass the same metrics for spinal cord imaging data, supplemented with additional metrics for spinal cord morphometry. For details regarding the raw data please visit <https://www.cneuromod.ca>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dataset provided for NeuroLibre preprint.
